# mounttracker
Mount collection tracker for World of Warcraft

Project written in Javascript using nodejs for api.

### Running
Project is configured to use nodemon for automatic refresh on save - there seems to be a bug on Windows 10 
which will need this installed manually as a global package so run ```npm install -g nodemon```

Run ```npm install``` in project root then ```npm run start``` or run debug if using Visual Studio Code which
will run the nodemon configuration.
